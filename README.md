Duplicate File Finder
A simple Python web app that finds duplicate files in a directory using file hashing and displays the results in a Streamlit interface.

🚀 Features
- Recursively scans folders  
- Detects duplicate files using hashing (MD5)  
- Simple web UI using Streamlit  

🧠 How It Works
1. User enters a folder path  
2. The app scans all files inside the folder  
3. Each file is hashed using MD5  
4. Files with the same hash are treated as duplicates  
5. Duplicate file paths are displayed in the UI
